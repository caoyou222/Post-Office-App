## Setting Up
For developers, please do following commands: <br />
npm install react-native-elements --save <br />
npm install react-native-navigation --save <br />
npm install expo --save <br />
npm install react-native-router-flux --save <br />
npm install react-native-slide-view --save <br />
Or just simply: <br />
npm install <br />

For back-end developers: <br />
Compile and running Backend.java along with the ExampleRestApiModel.java: <br />
javac Backend.java <br />
java Backend <portnumber> <br /> 
Change the server address (of every file .js) to where you run the server: http://<server>/<portnumber>/ <br />
In our case, the address is http://rns202-5.cs.stolaf.edu/28425/ <br />

## Technologies
We use react-native and expo for the app development and use Rest Api to do the backend server.
Postgresql as database. We also use Postman for testing notification
